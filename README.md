risp
====

A simple Lisp, written in Rust, based on the [Make A Lisp] project
instructions.

## ❗ ATTENTION ❗

I wrote the code in this project with a focus on learning instead of writing
production-quality code. MAL provides some very nice tests, and I leaned heavily
on those, to the point of not writing many tests of my own. I also followed the
MAL approach where there may have been a more Rust-y approach so that I could
leverage the troubleshooting tips MAL provides. Right now I'd consider this
proof-of-concept quality, so please don't judge me too harshly!
